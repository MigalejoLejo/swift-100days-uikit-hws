# Swift Learning – 100 Days of UIKit (Hacking with Swift)

This repo contains my solutions, notes, and experiments from Paul Hudson’s **100 Days of UIKit** course.  
The goal is to practice iOS development, improve my UIKit skills, and build a strong foundation for app development.

## 📚 About the Course
[100 Days of UIKit](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) is a free course by **Hacking with Swift (Paul Hudson)** that teaches UIKit through hands-on projects and daily challenges.

- Covers UIKit fundamentals, Auto Layout, animations, data persistence, and more.
- Encourages building real apps with incremental complexity.
- Focuses on practical, project-based learning.

## 🗂️ Repo Structure
Each day has its own folder with code and notes:

Day01-Project1/
Day02-Project1/
Day03-Challenge/
…

- **Projects** → guided apps built during the course.  
- **Challenges** → tasks I solved independently based on the day’s lessons.  
- **Notes** → personal takeaways, code snippets, and reflections.

## 🚀 Goals
- Build UIKit apps from scratch and understand how they work.  
- Develop problem-solving skills by completing challenges.  
- Gain confidence in UIKit before moving deeper into SwiftUI, Combine, and advanced iOS frameworks.
